DESCRIPTION:-
            This Python-based AES-256 Encryption Tool allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in GCM mode. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use and supports key derivation for strong security.

Key Features:
->AES-256 Encryption (GCM Mode) - Ensures data integrity and confidentiality.
->Key Derivation using PBKDF2 - Uses a salt and 100,000 iterations for added security.
->File Encryption & Decryption - Supports any type of file (text, images, PDFs, etc.).
->Cross-Platform Compatibility - Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
->CLI-based User Interaction - Allows encryption and decryption through a menu-driven interface.
